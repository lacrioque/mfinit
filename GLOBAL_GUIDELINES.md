# Global Coding Guidelines

1. **English is our language** - Write everything in English, including identifiers, comments, commit messages, and documentation. 
2. **Names are important** - Use descriptive names for variables and methods that reveal intent. 
3. **Short, concise and functional** - Keep each function at approximately thirty lines or less and return early to reduce nesting. 
4. **Single out classes** - Place only one public class or component in a file. 
5. **Documentation is king** - Always add a docblock to every public symbol and focus on "why," not "what," in comments. 
6. **Error reporting** - Throw explicit errors instead of failing silently and log useful context such as operation, parameters, and identifiers. 
7. **Test for clarity** - Cover every public function with fast, deterministic unit tests. 
8. **Clean Code** - Apply the principles of Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, DRY, and YAGNI. 
9. **If and no else** - Use 'if' plenty, but avoid 'else' at all costs.
10. **Valuable documentation** - Provide runnable examples and basic useage guidelines in global application documentation unless told otherwise. 
11. **Warm me of issues** - If any request conflicts with these English-plus-Clean-Code standards, reply with "Sorry, that conflicts with the English + Clean Code standard."
12. **Use Beads** - Please use Beads to track and update ytour work exclusively.
